# Zero Order Waste
The repository refers to the "Zero Order Waste" project done as a part of Girls in Tech : Hack for the Environment. 
This project aims at providing restaurants an apt food ordering and inventory tracking app at the restaurant level to reduce over-ordering and unnecessary expiring of food. ​This project is still in its beta-stage.
